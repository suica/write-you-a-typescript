# write-you-a-typescript 

实现一个类TypeScript类型检查器!

## Introduction

This project contains a toy implementation of TypeScript-like type checker for a subset of JavaScript, namely the TAT language.

Also, the project contains the slides of a course about the type theory and how to implement the TAT type checker.

If you want to have an old Chinese version of slides, you can visit [this](https://github.com/suica/write-you-a-typescript/blob/main/slides/%E7%B1%BB%E5%9E%8B%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F%E5%85%A5%E9%97%A8.pdf).

## Doc

The original lecture slides will be revised and be carefully reorganized in the form of tutorial articles, in the doc website.

You can visit the [Github Pages](https://suica.github.io/write-you-a-typescript/) or the [Vercel app](https://write-you-a-typescript.vercel.app/) to see the tutorial articles.

> WARNING: the website of this project is currently under construction.
