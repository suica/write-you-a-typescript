# Write You a Typescript-like Type Checker

[简体中文](./README.md)


## Introduction

This project contains a toy implementation of TypeScript-like type checker for a subset of JavaScript, namely the TAT language.

Also, the project contains the slides of a course about the type theory and how to implement the TAT type checker.

## Doc

The original lecture slides will be revised and be carefully reorganized in the form of tutorial articles, in the doc website.

You can visit the [Github Pages](https://suica.github.io/write-you-a-typescript/) or the [Vercel app](https://write-you-a-typescript.vercel.app/) to see the tutorial articles.
